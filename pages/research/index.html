<p>Maintaining a Mission in a Market-Based Context: Policy Advocacy and Engagement Among Charter Schools in New York City</p>

<p>Committee: Janelle Scott (Chair), Daniel Perlstein, Christopher Ansell</p>

<h4 id="dissertation-abstract">Dissertation Abstract</h4>

<p>For over two decades, policymakers have sought to expand and replicate high-performing charter schools as a way to improve public education. Advocates of this approach claim that replacing the public school bureaucracy with a “marketplace” of private providers will render schools more responsive to families, and competitive effects will improve school quality. However, despite consensus among many policymakers, reformers, and philanthropists on the efficacy of market-based reforms, not all charter schools are driven by market theory. Instead, some charters are centered on a particular pedagogical, political, or social mission, such as instituting an innovative curricular approach or serving students from historically underserved backgrounds. Yet little research has investigated how so-called “mission-oriented” charter schools emerge and thrive in a policy context that favors market principles. In this comparative case study, I employ conceptual tools from urban regime theory, theories of deliberative democracy, and social network theory to examine how four mission-oriented charter schools in New York City garner political, financial, and ideological support. I also investigate the relationship between a charter school’s mission and its approach to building support, and the extent to which leaders and advocates of mission-oriented charters gather support in an equitable and democratic manner. By shedding light on an under-examined aspect of the charter landscape, this study will extend the empirical and theoretical scholarship on educational privatization. Further, this study will illuminate to what extent, and under what conditions, an alternative vision of public schooling can be realized in a society deeply informed by market principles.</p>
